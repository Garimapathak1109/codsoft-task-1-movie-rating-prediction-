# Movie Ratings Prediction with Linear Regression
# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict movie ratings based on features like duration, votes, genre, and cast involvement. Inspired by a task from Cod Soft, the project illustrates how data-driven approaches can forecast movie ratings by leveraging key features.

# Key Steps
1. Data Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis and visualizations helped identify data structure, outliers, and any missing values.
Data Cleaning: Categorical features (genres, actors) were encoded, while missing values in numerical columns were filled using mean values, creating a clean dataset for model training.
2. Data Visualization
Visualizations provided critical insights:

Correlation Heatmaps: Highlighted relationships between features.
Distribution Plots: Showed the spread and distribution of features such as duration and votes.
Box Plots: Used to identify and manage outliers, ensuring data integrity before model training.
3. Model Training
Train-Test Split: The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s generalization on new data.
Linear Regression Model: A linear regression model was trained on the prepared dataset to predict movie ratings.
4. Model Evaluation
Model performance was measured with:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Quantified the error between predicted and actual ratings.
R² Score: Measured the variance in movie ratings explained by the model.
# Results
The model achieved balanced MSE and R² scores, indicating it effectively captured relationships within the data.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how linear regression can be used to make predictive insights on structured data. Future improvements could explore more advanced models or feature engineering techniques for enhanced accuracy.

This project provides a practical example of predictive modeling using data science techniques. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!
